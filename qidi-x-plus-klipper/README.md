## Printer

These configurations are from my QIDI X-Plus which has been modified with a [Icarus carriage](https://www.printables.com/model/130789-icarus-2-qidi-x-max-x-plus-i-mate-carriage-orbiter), Bondtech LGX Lite, Mosquito hotend, and Klipper. Stock belts and pulleys.

I am running MainsailOS on a Raspberry Pi 4 and KlipperScreen powering the official Raspberry Pi 7 inch touch screen.
